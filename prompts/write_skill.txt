# Output: Complete SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter and structured content

#   - Imperative tone ("Do X", not "You should do X")
#   - Under 500 lines (split into SKILL.md + references/ if longer)
#   - H1 → H2 → H3 heading hierarchy
#   - No redundancy with parent skills (reference via depends_on instead)
